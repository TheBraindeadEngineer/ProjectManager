# My fancy ProjectManager

I started this project because I wanted to do something with WinUI 3.<br>
Due to the lack of my creativity I was thinking a lot about what I could make.<br>
Then I had the genius idea to make a project to manage my non-existent projects.

## Features to be implemented

- Add/Edit Project
- Kanban
- File Explorer
- File Editor

## Features implemented

- Load Projects

***

I will try to write a project manager that can actually be used :)
